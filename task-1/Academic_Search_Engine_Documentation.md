### 2.2 Data Collection and Crawling Infrastructure

**Data Source and Crawling Strategy:**
The system targets publication data from Coventry University's research portal, focusing on economics, finance, and accounting publications. The crawling infrastructure employs advanced web scraping with intelligent scheduling:

**Crawling Components:**
1. **Base Crawler (`crawler.py`)**:
   - Selenium-based automation for dynamic JavaScript content
   - Multi-threaded processing with configurable worker pools
   - Robots.txt compliance with automatic crawl delay enforcement
   - Cloudflare bypass and cookie handling
   - Robust error handling and retry mechanisms

2. **Crawler Scheduler (`crawler_scheduler.py`)**:
   - Automated job scheduling with multiple frequency options (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Job persistence and state management in SQLite
   - Parallel execution with thread safety
   - Comprehensive logging and result tracking

3. **Incremental Crawler (`incremental_crawler.py`)**:
   - Smart change detection using content hashing
   - Processes only new or modified publications
   - Publication tracking and change history
   - Performance optimization for regular updates

4. **Robots.txt Parser (`robots_parser.py`)**:
   - Automated robots.txt fetching and parsing
   - Crawl delay extraction and enforcement
   - Rate limiting based on Request-rate directives
   - Sitemap discovery and URL compliance checking

5. **Configuration Management (`crawler_config.py`)**:
   - Centralized settings for all crawler components
   - JSON-based configuration with validation
   - Runtime parameter adjustment
   - Environment-specific configurations

**Data Pipeline:**
1. **Robots.txt Compliance**: Automatic robots.txt checking and crawl delay enforcement
2. **Content Discovery**: Automated page navigation and publication identification
3. **Data Extraction**: Title, authors, abstracts, publication years, and URLs
4. **Change Detection**: Hash-based comparison for incremental updates
5. **Data Validation**: Quality checks and deduplication
6. **Database Storage**: Structured storage with relationship tracking
7. **Index Updates**: Automatic search index reconstruction

**Enhanced Data Schema:**
```sql
-- Core publications table
CREATE TABLE publications (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    title TEXT,
    authors TEXT,  -- JSON array
    abstract TEXT,
    year TEXT,
    link TEXT,
    UNIQUE(title, year)
);

-- Crawler job management
CREATE TABLE crawl_jobs (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    frequency TEXT NOT NULL,
    enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    last_run TEXT,
    next_run TEXT,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
    max_pages INTEGER,
    max_workers INTEGER DEFAULT 2,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    run_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    success_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

-- Incremental crawling state
CREATE TABLE page_snapshots (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    url TEXT NOT NULL,
    content_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_modified TEXT NOT NULL,
    publication_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    UNIQUE(url)
);
```

### 2.3 Indexing and Data Structures

**Inverted Index Construction:**
The system employs inverted indexing for efficient query processing:

1. **Tokenization**: Text segmentation using regular expressions
2. **Stop Word Removal**: Elimination of common words
3. **Term Normalization**: Case folding and stemming
4. **Index Building**: Creation of term → document mappings

**Index Structure:**
```python
inverted_index = {
    'term': {
        'title': [doc_id1, doc_id2, ...],
        'authors': [doc_id3, doc_id4, ...],
        'abstract': [doc_id5, doc_id6, ...],
        'year': [doc_id7, doc_id8, ...]
    }
}
```

### 2.4 Query Processing Pipeline

**Multi-Stage Query Processing:**

1. **Query Validation**: Input sanitization and security checks
2. **Query Parsing**: Classification into query types:
   - Simple: Basic keyword search
   - Boolean: AND, OR, NOT operators
   - Phrase: Quoted exact phrases
   - Advanced: Field-specific searches

3. **Query Expansion**: Synonym integration for improved recall
4. **Term Weighting**: TF-IDF calculation for relevance scoring

**Query Types Supported:**
- **Simple Queries**: `machine learning`
- **Boolean Queries**: `economics AND education NOT assessment`
- **Phrase Queries**: `"higher education"`
- **Field Queries**: `author:smith title:"financial analysis"`

### 2.5 Relevance Ranking Algorithm

**Multi-Factor Ranking System:**

The ranking algorithm combines multiple relevance signals:

```python
final_score = (
    tf_idf_score * 0.30 +           # Term relevance
    title_match_score * 0.25 +      # Title matching bonus
    author_match_score * 0.15 +     # Author relevance
    abstract_match_score * 0.10 +   # Abstract content match
    year_relevance_score * 0.05 +   # Recency preference
    citation_score * 0.05 +         # Citation-based authority
    query_coverage_score * 0.15 +   # Query term coverage
    field_specificity_score * 0.10  # Field-specific bonuses
)
```

**TF-IDF Implementation:**
```python
def calculate_tf_idf(term, field, doc_id):
    tf = term_frequency(term, field, doc_id)
    df = document_frequency(term)
    idf = log(total_documents / df)
    return tf * idf
```
