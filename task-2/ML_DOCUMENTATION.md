2. **Feature Engineering**: Convert text to numerical features
3. **Classification Model**: Multinomial Naive Bayes
4. **Probability Calibration**: Improve confidence scores
5. **Domain Enhancement**: Boost category-specific terms

## üß† Algorithm Choice: Why Naive Bayes?

### **Multinomial Naive Bayes** was chosen for several reasons:

#### ‚úÖ **Advantages:**
```python
# Why Naive Bayes works well for text classification:
base_nb = MultinomialNB(alpha=0.3)
```

1. **Probabilistic Nature**: Provides interpretable confidence scores
2. **Efficiency**: Fast training and prediction on sparse text features
3. **Robustness**: Handles high-dimensional feature spaces well
4. **Small Dataset Friendly**: Works effectively with 114 training articles
5. **Text-Optimized**: Specifically designed for discrete features (word counts)

#### üìä **Mathematical Foundation:**
```
P(class|document) = P(document|class) √ó P(class) / P(document)

Where:
- P(class|document) = Probability of class given document
- P(document|class) = Likelihood of document given class  
- P(class) = Prior probability of class
- P(document) = Evidence (normalization factor)
```

#### ‚öñÔ∏è **Trade-offs:**
- **Assumption**: Features are independent (rarely true in text)
- **Mitigation**: Use n-grams to capture some dependencies
- **Benefit**: Still performs well despite violated assumptions

---

## üîß Feature Engineering Strategy

### 1. **TF-IDF Vectorization**
```python
self.vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(
    max_features=15000,  # Why 15K? Balance between info and efficiency
    stop_words='english',  # Remove common words like "the", "and"
    lowercase=True,        # Normalize case
    ngram_range=(1, 3),    # Unigrams, bigrams, trigrams
    min_df=1,              # Include rare but potentially important terms
    max_df=0.85,           # Remove overly common terms
    sublinear_tf=True,     # Use log-scaled term frequency
    use_idf=True           # Apply inverse document frequency
)
```

#### **Why These Parameters?**

**üî¢ max_features=15000:**
- **Reasoning**: More features = better text representation
- **Trade-off**: Memory vs. performance
- **Sweet Spot**: 15K provides rich representation without overfitting

**üìù ngram_range=(1, 3):**
- **Unigrams**: Single words ("health", "politics")
- **Bigrams**: Word pairs ("public health", "stock market") 
- **Trigrams**: Three-word phrases ("centers for disease")
- **Why**: Captures context and phrasal meanings

**‚ö° sublinear_tf=True:**
- **Formula**: 1 + log(tf) instead of raw tf
- **Benefit**: Reduces impact of very frequent words
- **Result**: Better balanced feature importance

### 2. **Domain-Specific Feature Weighting**
```python
# Triple the weight of domain-specific keywords
self.domain_keywords = {
    'politics': ['government', 'election', 'vote', 'senator', ...],
    'business': ['revenue', 'profit', 'market', 'investment', ...], 
    'health': ['treatment', 'disease', 'medical', 'patient', ...]
}

# Implementation: Repeat important words
for word in words:
    enhanced_words.append(word)
    if word in domain_keywords:
        enhanced_words.extend([word] * 2)  # Triple total weight
```

#### **Why This Works:**
- **Signal Amplification**: Boosts discriminative features
- **Domain Knowledge**: Leverages human expertise
- **Interpretability**: Clear why certain predictions are made

## üìà Performance Optimization Techniques

### 1. **Probability Calibration**
```python
base_nb = MultinomialNB(alpha=0.3)
self.model = CalibratedClassifierCV(
    base_nb, 
    method='isotonic',  # Better than sigmoid for this dataset
    cv=5                # 5-fold cross-validation
)
```

#### **Problem Solved:**
Raw Naive Bayes probabilities can be poorly calibrated (overconfident or underconfident).

#### **Solution:**
**Isotonic Regression** maps raw probabilities to well-calibrated ones:
- **Input**: Raw NB probabilities
- **Output**: Calibrated probabilities closer to true accuracy
- **Result**: Confidence scores from 61-71% ‚Üí 97-100%

#### **Why Isotonic vs. Sigmoid?**
- **Isotonic**: Non-parametric, flexible curve fitting
- **Sigmoid**: Assumes S-shaped calibration curve
- **Choice**: Isotonic for small datasets, more flexible

### 2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
```python
alpha=0.3  # Laplace smoothing parameter
```

#### **Alpha Parameter (Smoothing):**
- **Purpose**: Handle unseen words in test data
- **Formula**: P(word|class) = (count + alpha) / (total_words + alpha √ó vocabulary)
- **0.3 vs 1.0**: Less smoothing = trust training data more
- **Trade-off**: Overfitting vs. generalization

### 3. **Advanced Text Preprocessing**
```python
def preprocess_text(self, text):
    # Remove URLs, emails (noise removal)
    text = re.sub(r'http[s]?://...', '', text)
    
    # Remove standalone numbers (usually not informative)
    text = re.sub(r'\b\d+\b', '', text)
    
    # Normalize whitespace
    text = ' '.join(text.split())
    
    # Domain keyword enhancement
    # ... boost important terms
```

#### **Each Step Explained:**
1. **URL/Email Removal**: Reduces noise, prevents overfitting to specific sites
2. **Number Removal**: Years, percentages usually don't help classification
3. **Whitespace Normalization**: Ensures consistent tokenization
4. **Keyword Enhancement**: Amplifies signal from important terms
